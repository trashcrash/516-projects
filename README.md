## Project 1
Use GFBS method to recover the original signal.
## Project 2
Find a periodic-like 20 ms signal in a speech signal, and compute an order 10 indirect least-squares model. Plot the log magnitude  of the frequency response (appropriately sampled in frequency) corresponding to the model you computed for the selected interval.
